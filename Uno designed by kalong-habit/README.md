# Uno engineered by kalong-habit

Since the last time I designed a PCB in 2019, I have never held a PCB design project again. Most of the projects that I handle are performance enhancement using embedded algorithms, troubleshooting hardware devices, and developing out-of-the box devices that I have not fully mastered in technology (and now I am slowly starting to understand the technology and how to outsmart it).<br><br>

This year, revolution *bring me back-to-basic* starting with regaining the skills that I have used in the past experience while I handled the project. As it happens, my brain memory brought me to regaining PCB design and honed it again using open source software, since in the past, I used EAGLE for designing it and itâ€™s paid (but free for student or educational purpose).<br><br>

I was inspired from Autodesk Instructurables (see this: https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-UNO-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Arduino-Uno-B/) by Being Engineer, then I designed my Uno according to my needs. I modified the DC port with a USB port, then I/O port with a pin header.<br><br>

The BoM and schematic has been uploaded in the folder. So, if you are interested, you can use it since it is an open source project.
